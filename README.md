# where_flare

## Goal
Create a 'wasted energy' marketplace to provide a platform for enterprising entrepeneurs to easily access energy sources that have historically been wasted. 

## Problem Solved
Flaring has been a problem for generations. Thus far, flaring gas has always been seen as a side affect of oil production, and a necessary evil. As new technologies have emerged, solving the problem has become a more realistic endeavor. To my knowledge, nobody has been effort into detailing opportunities to utilze flare gas in the past.

## Approach
As I have demostrated in previous projects, the information needed to pursue this project is availbel through the Texas Railroad Commission. What is new about my approach is that I will train a model that identifies a range of possible energy sources, categorizing them into tiers based on their potential energy. 

## Impact
Making this informatino more readily acessible and generting a marketplace of current and future energy sources, could be the springboard for future innovative ways to use the energy,

## Presentation
The final product, ideally, will be a website that links to a database and models, which will visually display current and future energy waste. 

## Data Sources
Texas RRC monthly production data dumps + drilling /production lease information to predict future flare
